We want Firefox Help to be usable by all Firefox users. This means we're writing for a general audience rather than one very familiar with computer techniques and terminology. Assume the person you're writing for doesn't know how to change preferences or add a toolbar button without step-by-step instructions. Also, we should assume that they haven't changed any of the default Firefox or operating system settings.</p>

      <p><strong>Pick a Good Title</strong><br>
The article title along with it's summary are the only things that the user has to judge whether or not an article will answer their question. We call this "User Confidence" and it directly impacts click through rates. Even if we serve the correct article at the top of the search results list, the user needs to make the mental connection between the search query and the results we display in order for them to click through to the article.</p>

      <p><strong>Titles are so important they get 3 slides!</strong><br>
An article's title should try to describe what the article is about. The important thing is for the first few words to be as understandable as possible, filled with keywords that are important. This will allow users to recognize what the article is about and click confidently. In addition, a title should follow these guidelines:</p>

     <div id="title3" class="slide"><div>
    <section>
     <ul>
      <li> Title length: Google's search results page will display up to 70 characters. Your title can be longer than this if necessary but make sure your important keywords are in the first 70 characters.</li>
        <li>Try to vary the way you name articles. Don't use the same verbs or phrases in every title.</li>
        <li>Try to not use “-ing” words.</li>
        <li>Do not use a colon in the article title since it prevents creating a wiki link to that article <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749835">(bug 749835).</a><br>
Remember that the entire explanation doesn't have to go into the title. You can use the summary to give the user additional information about what is in the article.</li>

      <p><strong>How does the search engine index?
</strong><br>
Any word in any field (title, keywords, summary, content for a knowledge base article) is indexed by our search engine in its root form based on the English stemmer (currently no other languages supported). Thus when we index "cookies" or someone searches for "cookies", the stemmer cuts it down to something like "cook". Stop words, such as the, is, and at, are indexed but ignored. </p>

<div id="keywords1" class="slide"><div>
    <section>
      <header>
      </header>
      <p><strong>How does the keywords field work?
</strong><br>
The keywords field is indexed like any other field. This means that if your search term appears in the keyword field, that article will receive a certain number of points for match in this field. The article with the highest number of points across all indexed fields will be displayed at the top of the search results list. </p>
      <footer class="notes">

    </section>
  </div></div>
  
  <div id="keywords2" class="slide"><div>
    <section>
      <header>
      </header>
The keywords field (and all content fields) have preset maximum number of points that can be scored in the field. Not every match wins the full points for that field though. The search algorithms take into account the total number of words in the field and use this to factor in how many points the match is worth of the total possible points. For example, if the content field has a total of 10 points possible and you have 10 words total in this field and one is a match, then you'd receive 1 point for that match.<br>

    </section>
  </div></div>
  
  <div id="keywords3" class="slide"><div>
    <section>
      <header>
      </header>
Now, if you look at the same field and we have only 2 words and 1 of those words is a match, you would receive 5 total points. This is oversimplification of the entire process, but the principle is accurate. The more words you have in a field, the less each match will be worth.<br>
That means that if you add 10 keywords to an article that originally only had 1, you've just hurt the search rankings for that original keyword.

      <p><strong>When should I use the keywords field?
</strong><br>
The keywords field should be used as a last resort to achieve the appropriate search ranking for an article. We refer to this process as Content Tuning. In Content Tuning we manipulate the words in an article based on the words our customers use. That helps to boost the article higher in the search rankings so our users can find what they are looking for. The Keywords field is a very powerful search booster, but it should only be used as a last resort. If your article is getting poor search rankings (article visits only available for English KB), you should follow these steps:</p>

<div id="keywords5" class="slide"><div>
    <section>
     <ol>
      <li> Look at your title - Does your title accurately describe the circumstances this article would be useful?
</li>
        <li>Search summary - Does your search summary contain the words a user would use to describe what he wants?</li>
        <li>Body of the article - Look through the body of the article and be sure that you have used the language of the user. If there are a couple of different ways to describe the issue, try to use them both. Remember that brevity will increase the potency of the matches.
</li>
        <li>Keyword manipulation - If you've tried all of the other Content Tuning steps above and you are still getting poor results, you can try adding a keyword. The keyword should be the most important word your end user would use to describe the issue. DO NOT just list every possible way to describe the article topic in the keywords field. Remember, that will make each match worth fewer points in the search rankings. </li>

      <ul>
        <li>For a tutorial or how-to article: Give a brief summary of what things can be learned.
</li>
        <li>For a reference article: Give a brief explanation of the feature.
</li>
        <li>For a troubleshooting article: Give a brief summary of the problem and its symptoms.

The general idea here is to try to build skills from simple to complex while trying to keep the information needed by most people near the top. So a simple, common solution would usually come before a complex or edge-case solution. </p>

      <p><strong>Use templates in your step-by-step instructions
</strong><br>
There are a lot of common steps in Firefox articles. For these we create "templates" so that we don't have to write (and translate) them over and over again. Usually templates have instructions for all operating systems in them which makes writing out steps even easier. Here are the same steps as shown above but written using templates. </p>

There's nothing more frustrating than finally finding the instructions you need and then getting stranded while trying to follow them because the writer assumed you knew something you didn't. This is why we break our instructions out into complete, numbered steps. If you have to click "OK" at some point we even make that a step. </p>
